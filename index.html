					<h2>My Future</h2>
					<div class="#"></div><img src="./Static/images/Yonce.jpeg" atl="Fiance" style="width: 500px;" />
					<p>I moved to Boston, Massachusetts 2 years ago for TSA and discovered it wasn't really what I
						wanted to be. The reason
						why I chose Boston is because my now fiance (I call her my Yonce) is from here and I wanted to
						live on my own in a place that wasn't
						where I grew up. Akyanna has been super suportive of my journey and passions and without her,
						life wouldn't be
						as fun and adventurous. </p>

					<p>Fast forward to the infamous year 2020, I was furloughed from my job as an Assitant Aquatics
						Director.
						That is when I discovered my love for coding, I saw on tv a latina girl doing it and thought
						hmmm why not me? So just a few
						weeks ago I took the plunge resigned my job and am now studying software development with Coding
						Temple full time!
					</p>
					<p>I like the asthetics of being a developer and creating something from scracth or even building
						more from already
						developed code and continuing to grow. My biggest reason why I want to become a software
						developer is because I want to
						find a career that I am passionate about, while also openning oppurtunities for self-growth as
						well. I think most
						developers have the same reasoning.</p>
					<h4>Goals:</h4>
					<ul>
						<li>Buy a house in Boston and Seattle.</li>
						<li>Buy a Jeep or 4runner and 1969 Ford Mustang.</li>
						<li>Traveled back to Venezuela and Europe.</li>
						<li>Get married to my fiance Akyanna.</li>
						<li>Adopt children and have a dog.</li>
						<li>Start my own business and get my MBA.</li>
						<li>Build generational wealth.</li>
						<li>Be more kind, humble, and help as many people as I can.</li>
						<li>Be healthy both mentally and physically.</li>
						<li>Find a fullfiling career as Software Engineer.</li>
					</ul>
